# Homepage

A responsive homepage — something you might find on a portfolio site of sorts.

This is _not_ my actual portfolio site, but rather my final HTML/CSS project in the [Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) path of [The Odin Project (TOP)](https://www.theodinproject.com) as a practice on [responsive design](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/advanced-html-and-css#responsive-design).
